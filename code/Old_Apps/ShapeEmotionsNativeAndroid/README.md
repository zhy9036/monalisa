NOTE: If you are looking for the working android web view application, this is not it!  

This was our attempt at creating a Native Android Application that had support for preset emotions that were sent to the server through HTTP Post Requests. 

NOTE: This code is NOT in a working state, and does not correctly make HTTP Post Requests to the server. This is included in our repository only for historical significance and to act as an example for future teams if they decide to go with a natively developed Android app.
